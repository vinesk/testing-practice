# JavaScript Testing Practice

This project is a collection of simple JavaScript exercises to practice writing tests using Jest. The exercises are based on the Testing Practice assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice).

## Overview

The project includes implementations and tests for the following functionalities:

- **capitalize**: A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- **reverseString**: A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- **calculator**: An object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each function takes two numbers and returns the correct calculation.
- **caesarCipher**: A function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns the string with each character shifted by the shift factor.
- **analyzeArray**: A function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with properties: average, min, max, and length.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing

## Getting Started

To run these exercises and their tests, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can check your installation by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Tests

To execute the tests and see the results, run:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will run Jest and execute all the tests defined in the project. Jest will report the results in the terminal, showing which tests passed and which failed.
